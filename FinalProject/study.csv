The project will develop knowledge about physical activity in persons with Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) in Norway. We plan to explore instruments to measure physical activity level for the target-group at the community level. We want to understand which type of activities, activity intensities and how persons with CMT perform habitual physical activity. Subsequently, a physical activity measurement instrument adapted to persons with CMT will be developed. This instrument can be used in a future intervention project to promote physical activity in this group.

Brief Summary       
      
This cohort study (participants with CMT and control participants) has two parts (Part 1: CMT1A cohort; Part2: CMT1B, CMT2A and CMTX1 cohort) and is proposed to take place over 3 years across three sites. Participants with CMT aged 5-60 for potential enrolment in the trial will be identified through the existing inherited neuropathy clinics at each site and control participants will be identified among the unaffected relatives and carers of the participants with CMT. If they show interest in participating, they will be given the relevant Patient Information Sheets, Written Consent forms and/or Assent forms. Half of the participants will be recruited at the UK sites (NHNN and GOSH) and the other half at the US collaborating site. Each participant will be invited to two separate research visits (12 months apart) for which travel expenses (return journey) will be reimbursed. Each research visit is expected to last approximately 3 hours and during it, relevant detailed clinical data will be collected (CMTPedS for participants with CMT aged 5-20, CMTESv2-R for participants with CMT over the age of 10, CMT-HI for participants with CMT over the age of 16) and the participant will also undergo an MRI scan (up to 45 minutes) of the lower limbs (feet and calves or calves and thighs). Two separate neuromuscular MRI protocols with specific sequences will be used for the scans of foot and calf muscles and scans of calf and thigh muscles. Blood samples for plasma NEFL levels will be optional at both research visits for the participants at the UK trial sites; plasma NEFL levels will be processed according to our previously published protocol

Ultrasound Localization and Guided Injection for Superior Cluneal Nerve Entrapment
            
","
Brief Summary       
      
Low back pain (LBP) is a common complaint in the clinical setting. Among all the differential diagnosis for LBP, superior cluneal nerve (SCN) entrapment is the commonly omitted one. The superior cluneal nerve is the terminal branch of the lateral branches of the posterior rami of the L1-L3 spinal nerves, which passes through the osseous tunnel interposed between the thoracolumbar fascia and iliac crest. This nerve can be entrapped due to poor posture, trauma or stretching of the surrounding thoracolumbar fascia and osseous membrane. The cardinal symptom of the superior cluneal nerve entrapment is buttock pain. Sometimes the pain may radiate to the lower limb, which mimics sciatica, and makes the diagnosis difficult. Early diagnosis and treatment of SCN entrapment is crucial, which can facilitate the improvement of health related quality of life and decrement the socioeconomic loss due to disability.
The study aims is (1) to scan the SCN and thoracolumbar fascia by ultrasound in patients with LBP and normal subjects. The transcutaneous electrical stimulation will be used to confirm the location of SCN by asking the subject to depict the sensory distribution after stimulation; (2) to analyze the related factors of LBP with SCN entrapment, which may help in setting up the diagnostic criteria of SCN entrapment; (3) to analyze the therapeutic effect of perineural injection to SCN in SCN entrapment, and to find the factors that related responsiveness.

The purpose of the study is to investigate utility and appropriateness of treatment interventions taking into account the presumed mechanisms of two main varieties of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE). The investigators hypothesize that in patients with UNE under the humeroulnar aponeurosis (HUA) surgical HUA release (simple decompression) is superior to conservative treatment. By contrast, in patients with UNE at the retroepicondylar (RTC) groove surgical HUA release (simple decompression) should not be superior to conservative treatment.

Randomized Trial of Supercharged End-to-Side Anterior Interosseous Nerve Transfer for Severe Cubital Tunnel Syndrome
            
","
Brief Summary       
      
Functional motor recovery distal to a peripheral nerve lesion is predicated upon time to reinnervation of the motor end plate and the number of regenerate axons that reach the target. Supercharged end-to-side (SETS) transfer of the anterior interosseous nerve to the motor fascicle of the ulnar nerve at the level of the distal forearm has been proposed as an adjunct procedure in severe cubital tunnel syndrome to augment motor recovery of the ulnar-innervated intrinsic muscles. Multiple Level IV Therapeutic studies and a systematic review of Level IV Therapeutic studies have reported favorable clinical and electrodiagnostic outcomes following SETS for cubital tunnel syndrome, with low rates of complications. However, in the absence of controls, it remains unclear what proportion of the observed intrinsic motor recovery is attributable to the SETS procedure. The objective of this randomized trial is to compare the results of ulnar nerve decompression with or without SETS for severe cubital tunnel syndrome.

The ACTS Trial: N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and Night-splinting as a Non-operative Treatment for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
            
","
Brief Summary       
      
Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common nerve compression syndrome worldwide, causing significant chronic pain, functional impairment, and lowered quality of life for individuals of various backgrounds. CTS is caused by chronic compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel of the wrist, causing numbness and pain in the palm, thumb, index, and middle fingers and eventual weakness of the hand. Many different treatments for CTS have been proposed and studied, including but not limited to non-operative treatments such as wrist splinting, steroid injections, and lifestyle modifications as well as operative treatments, such as surgical carpal tunnel release (CTR). To date, very few oral medications have been shown to be effective as conservative treatments for CTS. In this study the investigators will examine whether there is any benefit to using oral N-acetylcysteine (NAC) as an adjunctive treatment for mild to moderate CTS in addition to a standard 8-week trial of night splinting. NAC has been used in humans for various purposes, is extremely safe and has very few side effects, and has been shown to have anti-inflammation properties which may help treat CTS. The investigators will study this by performing a randomized controlled trial, comparing patients receiving oral NAC and standard night splinting to patients receiving an identical placebo and standard night splinting. Both patient groups will be assessed using a questionnaire to assess for severity of their CTS symptoms both before and after the 8-week treatment. The primary objective will be to determine whether supplementation with oral NAC in addition to night splinting has any significant impact on patient-reported symptoms and functional impairment when compared to night splinting alone. The investigators will also measure secondary outcomes including whether patients decide to have surgery for their CTS after treatment and/or continued use of other treatments. This study has the potential to have a significant positive impact on patients by identifying a safe, inexpensive, accessible, and well tolerated conservative treatment for mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome, and potentially preventing the need for additional, more invasive treatments such as surgery.

Cubital Tunnel Syndrome and Diffusion MRI: A Proof of Concept Study
            
","
Brief Summary       
      
Cubital Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) results from compression of the ulnar nerve at the elbow (colloquially termed the ""funny bone""). CTS affects up to 6% of the population and 6000 patients undergo surgery annually in the UK. Surgery is the only proven treatment for CTS, although up to 30% of patients do not improve. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop a reliable test to diagnose CTS to improve the selection of patients for surgery.
New techniques in the field of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allow the visualisation of nerve structure and function. Diffusion tensor MRI, also known as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), can diagnose CTS with superior diagnostic accuracy and could enable the reliable diagnostic of CTS, improving the selection of patients for surgery.
The study will include healthy volunteers (to refine the scanning sequence) and patients undergoing surgery for CTS. Patients will be scanned preoperatively and postoperatively using cutting-edge diffusion MRI techniques. The primary outcome will be change in the MRI-derived diffusion metrics following surgery. Secondary outcomes will consider how MRI relates to patient-reported outcomes and conventional clinical tests (ultrasound and nerve conduction studies).
Leeds is the ideal location for this research because a) Leeds institutions are the most highly cited organisations in musculoskeletal research, b) Leeds houses the National Centre for Hyperpolarized MRI and a state-of-the-art MRI scanner, and c) Leeds is an internationally recognised centre of excellence for complex upper limb surgery.

Brief Summary       
      
The objective of this study is to determine if nerve glide exercises in patients with cubital tunnel syndrome can improve pain, paraesthesias and reduce the need for future surgery. Cubital tunnel syndrome is a common form of peripheral neuropathy caused by compression of the ulnar nerve at the elbow. Surgical intervention is typically reserved for those with severe symptoms, but many cases can be treated with non-operative measures. This study will look at the efficacy of nerve glide exercises in the management of cubital tunnel syndrome. 70 subjects with cubital tunnel syndrome will be enrolled and randomized into groups receiving either standard conservative measures or standard measures in addition to nerve glide exercises. Outcomes will be measured 6 months after initiation of treatment with questionnaires on clinical symptoms and function to see if there is a difference between the two groups.

PECS II Block in Thoracic Outlet Decompression
            
","
Brief Summary       
      
Rationale: Postoperative pain management after transaxillary thoracic outlet decompression surgery (TATOD) is difficult. In a retrospective case-control trial, we found evidence that a PECS II block is able to reduce pain and morphine consumption. This may ultimately lead to less morphine induced side-effects and improved patient satisfaction. However, the risk of bias in retrospective research is high. To determine the effect of PECS II in TATOD, a randomized controlled double blinded trial could offer more valuable scientific evidence. Our hypothesis is that a PECS II block will reduce pain, opioid use and opioid induced side-effects in patients undergoing transaxillary TOD (TATOD).
Objective: The aim of the study is to determine the effect of a PECS II block on postoperative pain and opioid use in patients undergoing TATOD. The secondary objective is to determine the effect of a PECS II block on opioid induced side effects such as postoperative nausea and vomitus and the quality of recovery Study design: Single centre randomized controlled double blinded trial Study population: All patients with Neurogenic Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (NTOS) selected for TATOD by the TOS multidisciplinary workgroup and based on the specifications in 2016 SVS reporting standards.
Intervention: The study group will receive a PECS II block with 40 ml ropivacaine 5 mg/ml. The control group will receive a PECS II block with 40 ml NaCL 0.9%.
Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary outcome parameters are postoperative pain using the Numeric Rated Scale (NRS) score assessed at rest and when moving and postoperative morphine-equivalent consumption. Secondary outcome parameters are postoperative Nausea and Vomitus (PONV) and Quality of Recovery questionnaire (QoR-15).
Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: All patients will undergo ultrasound guided injection, after induction of anaesthesia. The administration of the injection does not invoke any extra physical discom-fort. Possible complications include hematoma and pneumothorax, however, the risk is very low (<1%)[1]. In the intervention group, we expect less pain, a reduced need for pain medica-tion and less postoperative nausea and vomitus. We do not expect an altered postoperative course in the control group. Patients will be asked to fill out a questionnaire. Extra blood sam-ples, site visits, physical examinations or other test will not be done in this study.

Brief Summary       
      
Pudendal neuralgia is a frequent diagnosis in pain clinics. This perineal pain has devastating effects on patient's quality of life. Today, 30% of patients are refractory to pain management and surgical procedure.
The neuropathic characteristics of the pain in these patients lead us to test the efficiency of spinal cord stimulation at conus medullaris level.
In our published preliminary study involving 27 patients with refractory pudendal neuralgia, we demonstrated that 74% of patients implanted with stimulation electrodes at the conus medullaris responded to stimulation.
The primary objective of the present trial is to assess through a randomized, parallel group design, the effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation at the conus medullaris using pentapolar surgical lead ((TM)Penta, St Jude medical ANS) versus medical treatment alone on sitting time in refractory pudendal neuralgia.

Evaluation of the Muscular FORCE in the Upper Limbs of Patients Presenting a Thoracic Outlet Syndrome
            
","
Brief Summary       
      
The thoracic outlet syndrome is a rare but debilitating pathology, responsible for upper limb pain. Its frequency is probably underestimated because of diagnostic difficulties. This syndrome encompasses several entities including compressions of neurological, venous or arterial origin. In addition to pain, the majority of patients report fatigability and loss of strength in the upper limbs. However, the quantification of this loss of strength and fatigability has hardly been studied.
In addition, the rehabilitation treatment is the first-line treatment of this pathology. It most often includes a muscle building phase.
In this project, we would like to evaluate the proximal and distal force of patients presenting a thoracic outlet syndrome by comparing them to a population free from any pathology in the upper limbs. This evaluation would involve an isokinetic strength analysis of shoulder rotators at the proximal level, using an isokinetic dynamometer. At the distal level, the evaluation would be done using force clamps.
In a second step, we will also be able to evaluate the effects of the reeducation on the strength and the muscular fatigability of the patients presenting a thoracic outlet syndrome.

Effect of High-quality Pre-operative Videos on Patient Anxiety Levels Prior to Ambulatory Hand Surgery
            
","
Brief Summary       
      
Previous research has shown that YouTube is a poor source of high-quality medical information. This is likely because there is no regulation of the content on YouTube and relatively little of the content is posted by qualified medical professionals. It is known that up to 30% of patients use the internet to research the procedure they will be having and given the increasing popularity of YouTube we suspect many patients are using YouTube or similar sites as a source of information prior to elective surgery. There are likely a number of patient factors that contribute to patients seeking out videos as a source of pre-operative medical information. Patient age, which is generally inversely correlated to computer literacy, may have a role. Patient anxiety and pre-operative worrying may cause a patient to turn to the internet to search for information, and the poor overall quality of the content available may worsen pre-operative anxiety.
The primary objective of this study is to determine if providing patients with a reliable, high-quality video about their condition and operation prior to surgery reduces pre-operative anxiety. Secondary aims are to determine the percentage of patients that independently seek out videos online as a source of medical information prior to elective hand surgery, identify patient attributes that are associated with this behavior, and understand if introducing high quality pre-surgical videos has an impact on post-operative patient outcomes and/or patient engagement. The investigators hypothesize that providing patients with high-quality pre-operative videos will reduce pre-operative anxiety. Its is also expected that patients who seek out videos on their own for pre-operative medical information will be younger and have higher anxiety levels and pain catastrophizing scores. Additionally, the investigators hypothesize that patients who watch high-quality pre-operative videos may have better short term post-operative outcomes and greater engagement in their care than their counterparts that did not watch videos or who sought out videos on their own.

Effectiveness of a Tele-Rehabilitation Evidence-based Tablet App for Rehabilitation in Traumatic Bone and Soft Injuries of the Hand, Wrist and Fingers.
            
","
Brief Summary       
      
Trauma and soft injuries of the wrist, hand and fingers have a high incidence, and large social and healthcare costs are generated, mainly due to productivity loss. Therapeutic exercises must be part of the treatment and in the last 10 years the scientific literature highlights the need for the inclusion of the sensorimotor system in both surgical and rehabilitative approaches. Current methods as leaflets or videos lacks of adherence control, evolution control and knowledge of how the patient do the exercises which compromise the expected results. Touch-screens of Tablet devices have showed a large potential to cover these needs and for the retraining of sensorimotor system. ReHand is a Tablet digital tool (Android and iOS) to prescribe and monitor exercise programs based on sensorimotor approach and developed under the guidelines of various healthcare professionals (hand surgeons, physiotherapists, rehabilitators and occupational therapists) to implement home exercise programs and monitor patients. Subjects are selected by emergency, hand surgery, rehabilitation and physiotherapy services of six hospitals from Andalusian Public Health Service through consecutive sampling. Concretely, patients over 18 years of age with trauma and soft injuries of the wrist, hand and fingers, no more than 10 days after surgery or removal of immobilization. Experimental group will receive access to ReHand app to perform a monitored home exercises program. Control group will receive the conventional method employed: a home exercise program in paper with recommendations. Clinical variables will be assessed at baseline before group allocation, 4 weeks, 3 months and 6 months. At the end of the study, cost-utility variables will be analyzed.

Brief Title  ICMJE 

Does a Different Local Anesthetic Improve Pain After Carpal Tunnel Release?
            
","
Brief Summary       
      
This study is being conducted to determine whether addition of a longer-acting local anesthetic to our current anesthetic protocol improves the post-operative pain after carpal tunnel release. Participants undergoing carpal tunnel release (CTR) will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: the standard anesthetic or the longer-acting anesthetic. Participants will not be aware of their assignment. Carpal tunnel release will be performed in the standard fashion at our hospital. Participants will record their post-operative pain on a visual scale at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 hours after surgery. They will also record the location of their post-operative numbness at the same time intervals. The day after surgery, a research nurse will call each participant to inquire about their post-operative pain scores and numbness. Participants will also be asked about their consumption of oral painkillers (e.g. Tylenol, ibuprofen) during the first 24 hours. Participants will be re-assessed 3 months after surgery to evaluate improvement in carpal tunnel symptoms.
Participants who wish to have carpal tunnel release on both wrists will be randomized to receive one type of anesthetic for the first side and will receive the other anesthetic for the second side. They will not be made aware of which medication is used for each side. This will allow us to directly compare the difference in pain experience between the two anesthetics.
We hypothesize that use of a longer-acting local anesthetic will lead to decreased post-operative pain, especially in the first 4-8 hours after surgery.

Corticosteroid Injection Effectiveness in Carpel Tunnel Patients With Negative or Mild EMG Studies
            
","
Brief Summary       
      
Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is the most common nerve entrapment syndrome worldwide. There are currently no studies examining the effectiveness of corticosteroid injections in patients with normal (negative) EMG studies. The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of the duration of symptom improvement post corticosteroid injection in patients with negative or mild EMG studies. The Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire will be given to patients undergoing corticosteroid injections for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome to assess their response to the injection. Investigators will collect data retrospectively. The Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ) is administered as per standard protocol to all patients with CTS who have a negative or mild EMG study. The BCTQ assesses the patient's self-reported symptom severity and functional status. Investigators will analyze this data with respect to demographics as well as numbness in the median n. distribution, nocturnal numbness, weakness/atrophy of the thenar musculature, Tinel's sign, Phalen's test, loss of 2-point discrimination, Quick-Dash score, and grip strength score.
The primary outcome will be the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire outcome score under the different EMG conditions.The secondary outcomes will be numbness in the median n. distribution, nocturnal numbness, weakness/atrophy of the thenar musculature, Tinel's sign, Phalen's test, loss of 2-point discrimination, QuickDash score, and grip strength score. Both outcomes will be examined in patients with negative or mild EMG readings. This information will allow orthopedic physicians to gain a better understanding of the duration of symptom improvement post-corticosteroid injection, allowing them to fine tune their treatment plans for CTS patients.

Ketofol Versus Fenofol as Procedural Sedation for Carpal Tunnel Release
            
","
Brief Summary       
      
There are different methods of anesthesia for CTR surgery. Procedural sedation will allow rapid recovery and fewer complications than regional or general anesthesia (GA).
Attempts have been made in the past to use additives with propofol to reduce its dose. Ketofol (ketamine/propofol combination) was used for procedural sedation and analgesia. Ketamine and propofol administered in combination have offered effective sedation for spinal anesthesia and for gynecologic, ophthalmologic, and cardiovascular procedures in all age groups. The opposing hemodynamic and respiratory effects of each drug may enhance the utility of this drug combination, increasing both safety and efficacy and allowing reduction in the dose of propofol required to achieve sedation.
Propofol alone had a significantly greater number of apnea with desaturation (SpO2 < 90%) episodes. Further, it has been shown that during colonoscopies, propofol in combination with fentanyl provided similar patient satisfaction with shorter recovery times even at lower depths of sedation as compared to propofol. The addition of fentanyl to propofol has been shown to result in better operator feasibility with no difference in recovery time, cognitive impairment, or complications as compared to the use of propofol only for sedation.

Clinical Outcomes of USCTR vs. mOCTR
            
","
Brief Summary       
      
Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common peripheral entrapment neuropathy and affects 3-6% of adults in the United States. In patients with severe or refractory symptoms, carpal tunnel release (CTR) represents the definitive management option, and over 550,000 CTRs are performed annually in the United States with over 90% of patients reporting clinical improvement. Currently available CTR techniques include mini-open CTR via a single, 1-3 cm palmar incision (mOCTR), endoscopic CTR via one (wrist) or two (wrist and palm) 1-2 cm incisions (ECTR), and ultrasound guided CTR via a single < 1 cm wrist or palmar incision (USCTR). The primary objective is to assess the impact of USCTR vs mOCTR in a military population. This study is a multi-site prospective randomized comparative trial.
Participants with CTS will be randomized to a study arm and receive treatment with ultrasound guided carpal tunnel release (USCTR) vs. traditional mini-open carpal tunnel release (mOCTR). All patients will be followed for a period of 24 months with respect to standard clinical data, military relevant data, and validated patient related outcome measures (PROMs). Data will be collected at 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 1 month, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months, and 24 months post-CTR procedure.
Investigators hypothesize that USCTR using the SX-One MicroKnife® will safely and more-effectively improve symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome compared to traditional mOCTR, with less loss of military duty days.

WALANT Technique (Wide Awake Local Anesthesia No Tourniquet) for Carpal Tunnel Release.
            
","
Brief Summary       
      
The carpal tunnel release (CTR) is now performed almost exclusively under regional anesthesia (RA) in France. RA requires the use of a pneumatic tourniquet to limit blood flow to the operated extremity and create a bloodless surgical field for a clear visualization of the anatomic structures by the surgeon.
Multiple approaches to block the brachial plexus can be considered. The most common technique is the axillary block (BAX) that provides complete anesthesia for the patient's arm and forearm. This technique offers anesthesia not only for the surgical area but also for the root of the arm where the pneumatic tourniquet is placed. However this technique have limits: the persistence of a motor block in the arm and the forearm that is not compatible with a quick hospital discharge (short term ambulatory hospitalization) and the need for assistance with dressing and eating after surgery. More distal anesthetic techniques are proposed such as the troncular blocks (TRONC) that avoid motor block of the arm and offer an earlier recovery and autonomy for the patient. However, they lead to a poor tolerance to the tourniquet due to its application on a non-anesthetized area.The pain related to the pressure of the tourniquet can occur within the first few minutes of its inflation, get worse over time and persist for several minutes after its deflation. Therefore, TRONC procedure is less often performed compared to the BAX for major surgeries but it remains appropriate for CTR.
The Wide Awake Local Anesthesia No Tourniquet (WALANT) technique is widely used in Canada and has been proposed for hand and wirst minor surgeries. WALANT uses a combination of a local anesthetic (LA) and epinephrine to induce anesthesia and hemostasis in the area of the surgical procedure in order to allow surgeries to be done without the use of tourniquet. Epinephrine is a vasoconstrictor agent that reduces blood flow at surgical site. This bloodless effect is visualized on the skin by a pale color. Thus, WALANT can provide a chemical tourniquet and eliminate the pain from a traditional arm tourniquet. However, this technique is performed with a short-acting LA and does not offer any postoperative analgesia.
The association of TRONC using long-acting LA with the WALANT technique could combine the comfort of a surgery without tourniquet to a long-acting analgesia and thus could provide a superior overall comfort.
The main objective of this prospective, multicentre, randomized, open-label, parallel-group controlled trial is to evaluate the interest of WALANT technique on patient comfort during CTR performed with TRONC, compared to the tourniquet.

Systematic Transcutaneous Oxymetry Use in Thoracic Outlet Syndrome

Brief Summary       
      
The measurement of the transcutaneous oxygen partial pressure (TCPO2) at exercise is, to our knowledge, the only method to estimate during the exercise the importance of ischemia segment of limb by segment of limb bilaterally and carry on. The diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome causing remains difficult and dependent operator in ultrasound because of the risk of false positive (loss of signal) or false negative (insufficient effort, inappropriate movement).
Our main hypothesis is the existence of significant measurable ischemia in the forearm by transcutaneous oximetry during the maneuvering of the ""candlestick"".
In the event of failure of this maneuver, the other maneuvers such as those of Wright, Roos, Tinel and Adson will be realized.
In this study we want to evaluate the possibility of using dynamic transcutaneous Oximetry as a tool for evaluating ischemia in case of suspicion of thoracic outlet syndrome causing.

Brief Summary       
      
Recently, nerve hydrodissection is utilized to assist ultrasound-guided nerve injection and studies recommend its clinical benefit for peripheral entrapment neuropathy. Hyaluronic acid (HA) can decrease the post-surgery adhesion of soft tissue and nerve but its clinical application in clinical practice is very rare.
We just proved that single HA injection have short-term effectiveness in mild-to-moderate carpal tunnel (CTS) cases and this finding may hint the therapeutic effectiveness of nerve hydrodissection for CTS depend on absorption time of solution. In addition, no study compare different weight of HA for nerve injection so far. Hence, the purpose of this study aim to compare different weight of HA for CTS and whether hydrodissection effect depend on the absorption time of solution or not.

Comparing Superficial vs. Deep Local Anesthetic Infiltration to Improve Patient Experience During Carpal Tunnel Release
            
","
Brief Summary       
      
Hypothesis: When comparing superficial infiltration of local anesthetic to superficial and deep infiltration of local anesthetic in the setting of carpal tunnel release, the null hypothesis is that there will be no significant difference between the two techniques.
Background and study rationale: Carpal tunnel syndrome is a very common clinical problem with significant patient burden that can be reliably treated with surgical carpal tunnel release. To minimize operating room time burdens and to improve patient recovery time, this procedure is generally performed with the patient wide awake using local anesthetic. While the majority of patients are able to tolerate this type of procedure, there is always a possibility of some discomfort or pain experienced during the procedure. The investigators would like to compare two local anesthetic infiltration techniques to determine which is best to provide the least amount of pain or discomfort during a carpal tunnel release. The two methods are subcutaneous infiltration alone (superficial) and subcutaneous infiltration with infiltration into the carpal tunnel (deep).
Research Design: This study design is a prospective randomized control trial.
Methodology: Patients will be recruited and randomized on the morning of their surgery to undergo either superficial or superficial and deep local anesthetic infiltration using 10cc of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine buffered with 8.4% sodium bicarbonate. They will be blinded as to which group they are in.
Participants will complete the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire as a baseline for comparison as well as a brief questionnaire on demographics. After the procedure, participants will complete a short questionnaire about any pain experienced during the administration of the local anesthetic and during the procedure. Presence and intensity of pain during the procedure are the primary outcome of this study.
Secondary outcomes include pain rating at 2, 8, and 24 hours post-procedure and a follow up Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire score at 3 months. The surgeon will also make note whether there is any visible evidence of damage to the median nerve from deep infiltration at the time of surgery.
Statistical Analysis: The two groups (superficial vs. deep) will be compared directly for each of the outcomes listed in the methodology.

Electrophysiological Changes Based on the Palmaris Longus
            
","
Brief Summary       
      
One of the most important causes of carpal tunnel syndrome is increased pressure in the canal. With the loading of the palmaris longus at 20 degrees of wrist extension, the pressure within the canal increases more than the load exerted on other flexor tendons. Several studies have shown the association of carpal tunnel syndrome with the presence of palmaris longus. In this study, our aim is to investigate how the presence or absence of palmaris longus changes EMG measurements in the median nerve. Individuals with a diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome or entrapment neuropathy will be given the Schaffer test, a standardized test to test the presence of the palmaris longus muscle. The result will be noted, EMG examination will be requested and the electrophysiological properties of the median nerve will be recorded.

Corticosteroid and Repeated Dextrose Hydro-dissection for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Patients
            
","
Brief Summary       
      
Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most prevalent peripheral nerve entrapment of upper limb. Typical symptoms comprise pain, numbness or tingling of the thumb and index, middle or ring fingers. Thumb weakness and decreased grip strength can occur in the later stage. Currently treatments included physical modalities (low power laser, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, ultrasound), medication, splinting, injection and surgery. Ultrasound guided intracarpal hydro-dissection of median nerve had been proposed based on its accurate localization, while the injectates were diverse. Corticosteroid has been widely used for CTS for decades. However, growing evidences suggested that 5% dextrose, normal saline, platelet rich plasma injection also have therapeutic effects on alleviating CTS symptoms. Among the injectates, a single 5% dextrose injection could be considered as a substitute of corticosteroid based on its long term effect up to six months. However, the clinical efficacy of 5% dextrose injection has not validated by the further study. The investigators aim to compare the therapeutic effect of 5% dextrose injection with corticosteroid injection in patients with CTS, up to 12 weeks follow up.

Surgical Dressings After Endoscopic Carpal Tunnel Release
            
","
Brief Summary       
      
Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common compressive neuropathy in the upper extremity. While carpal tunnel release (CTR), both open (OCTR) and endoscopic (ECTR), is safe and effective, there are questions regarding the use of postoperative dressings after surgery. It is not currently known if dressing choices influence post-operative pain, function or patient satisfaction after ECTR. A less cumbersome dressing (bandaid) may allow patients to perform daily tasks with more ease after surgery. The purpose of this investigation is to compare postoperative pain scores and patient satisfaction after ECTR for patients treated with conventional post-operative bulky soft tissue dressings versus those treated with a bandaid after surgery. The hypothesis is that patients using a bandaid after surgery will have an easier time with functional tasks after surgery and that pain scores will not significantly differ between the two groups. Furthermore, this study aims to determine if there are differences in patient satisfaction, functional outcomes, complications, and unscheduled healthcare contact between these two groups. This will be a randomized, controlled investigation.

A Comparison of Ultrasound-guided Steroid Injection With Wrist Splint in Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
            
","
Brief Summary       
      
Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is caused by compression of a nerve called the median nerve as it travels through a narrow tunnel within the wrist on its way to the hand. Compression of the median nerve causes numbness, tingling, pain and weakness of the hand and fingers. CTS is usually treated with rest or a change in the activity level. It can also be treated with a splint that limits bending of the hand and wrist. Other treatments include a steroid injection near the median nerve. Surgery can be performed if the symptoms are severe or persistent.
Compression of the median nerve can cause swelling that may be observed with ultrasound of the wrist. Ultrasound can also be used to help guide the needle to inject the steroid solution in close proximity to the median nerve while avoiding injury to the nerve.
The investigators plan to compare the effectiveness of a splint and an ultrasound-guided steroid injection in the treatment of mild to moderate CTS. Individuals with CTS who agree to participate, will be randomly assigned to two groups. One group will be treated with a splint and the other with a steroid injection performed under ultrasound guidance. The severity of CTS symptoms will be determined prior to beginning the study and also at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year following each of the two treatment interventions. The median nerve size (diameter) will be measured in all participants prior to beginning the study and also following both treatment interventions at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year.
At the conclusion of the study, the investigators will determine which of the two treatments, splint or steroid injection, is more effective in alleviating CTS symptoms. The investigators will also determine if either or both treatments result in a change in swelling of the median nerve as measured by ultrasound.

Brief Summary       
      
The general aim of this research is to gain insight in the role of SSCT in the etiology and progression of CTS. We hypothesize that (degenerative) damage of the SSCT occurs early on in the pathogenesis of CTS. Fibrotic damage to the SSCT will lead to altered morphology and biomechanical characteristics. This eventually may lead to damage of the median nerve. To examine the SSCT an ultrasound technique described by Van Doesburg et al. 2012 will be used First, the reliability of the US technique to characterize morphology of the SSCT will be investigated. Secondly, cross-sectional data will be collected in healthy subjects and CTS patients to provide descriptive parameters and to describe differences between patients and controls. In the final part a prospective study will be conducted to look at changes of SSCT thickness over time and after treatment.

Radial Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy in the Treatment of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
            
","
Brief Summary       
      
Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common of all entrapment syndromes with a prevalence of 1-5%. Electrodiagnostic testing is used to make a definite diagnosis. The mainstay of the pathophysiology of CTS includes mechanical damage to the median nerve due to build up of pressure in the carpal tunnel and nerve ischaemia. Physical therapy (PT) in particular is the conventional non-surgical treatment of choice in the management of mild to moderate CTS, resulting in pain reduction and improved function.
Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) is a non invasive treatment method in which high frequency sound waves are applied to the body. The mechanism of action of ESWT in the treatment of CTS remains largely unknown.
Eventhough there are many therapeutic options in the treatment of mild to moderate CTS, there is no consensus on the most effective treatment (4). ESWT has become a desirable treatment option in recent years. However, due to small patients numbers in trials to date and a lack of placebo controlled studies, the efficacy of this treatment option is still under debate. This study aims to compare the efficacy of RESWT to the recommended conventional PT modalities, including therapeutic US, in the treatment of CTS with regards to nociceptive and neuropathic pain, functionality and nerve conduction study outcomes.

Conditioning Electrical Stimulation to Improve Outcomes in Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
            
","
Brief Summary       
      
Carpal tunnel syndrome is common, identified in 3% of the general population. Symptoms including numbness and pain are due to compression of the median nerve as it travels through a tunnel entering the wrist and can result in weakened grip strength and poor dexterity. Despite surgical release, nerve damage due to chronic compression often cannot be completely reversed, with resulting sensorimotor deficits. Postoperative electrical stimulation (ES) has been well-reported to improve nerve regeneration and is currently standard of practice at our institution. Investigators of this study have recently shown in an animal model that by changing the timing of the ES from postoperative to preoperative, this ""conditioning"" electrical stimulation (CES) significantly improves nerve regeneration.
Patients with severe carpal tunnel syndrome will be identified in plastic surgery clinics. Patients who consent to participating will undergo baseline testing including nerve conduction studies, sensory evaluation, motor testing, and patient-reported outcomes. Participants will be randomized to three groups: i) CES, ii) postoperative ES, and iii) no ES. CES will be delivered in clinic by placing a percutaneous needle alongside the median nerve, and stimulation will be delivered for one hour, with patient comfort dictating the voltage of stimulation. At the completion of one hour, the needle will be removed, and a standard carpal tunnel release will be performed by their plastic surgeon 4-7 days later. Patients will the second cohort will undergo postoperative ES immediately following their carpal tunnel release, using the same stimulation parameters as CES. The third cohort will receive only carpal tunnel release without stimulation.In all patients, sensory and motor reinnervation, using the same testing modalities as preoperative assessment, will be evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months post-operative.

Combined Effect of Insulin and Sodium Hyaluronate Injection Guided by Ultrasound in Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
            
","
Brief Summary       
      
Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common peripheral entrapment neuropathy with involving compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. The technique of perineural injection therapy (PIT) is now commonly used for peeling the nerve from surrounding soft tissue (called nerve hydrodissection), which may help to reduce neuro-inflammation, ischemic damage and allow impulse transmission.
The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of ultrasound guided insulin plus Sodium Hyaluronate injection in reducing symptoms caused by carpal tunnel syndrome.

Wild-type transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis is an underdiagnosed depository disease in which fibril monomers of misfolded amyloid protein accumulates in various tissues, including the heart, and cause tissue dysfunction.
Before onset of cardiac symptoms, many patients will have undergone surgery for idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome since the protein also deposits in the transversal carpal ligament of the hand.
This study investigates patients previously operated for idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome to determine if they display signs and symptoms of cardiac amyloidosis.

Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy Boost After Palliative Radiotherapy for Spinal Cord Compression
            
","
Brief Summary       
      
Spinal cord compression (SCC) is a devastating complication of advanced malignancy, and can cause significant deterioration in function and quality of life (QoL). The goal of treatment is to improve functional status and symptoms, but the optimal treatment regimen for these patients has not been thoroughly established. Many patients with SCC present with uncontrolled systemic disease and poor performance status, and are not eligible for standard surgical resection. They are generally treated with 3D conformal palliative RT (3DCRT) alone, however recent trials suggest that less than 70% of patients are ambulatory, that the re-establishment of ambulation in non-ambulatory patients is poor, and the duration of improvement is guarded with radiotherapy alone.
Recently, stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) used alone or after previous radiotherapy to treat spinal metastasis has demonstrated superior results in pain control, tumour response and durability. SBRT requires time for careful planning, and many patients with neurologic symptoms must be treated immediately to prevent progression. Therefore the role of SBRT is still unclear in this patient population, although it seems to be a potential alternative to surgical decompression in patient not suitable for surgery. The investigators propose a feasibility study to investigate the potential benefits of dose escalation with a sequential SBRT boost to urgent 3D CRT in the setting of SCC. This regimen will allow inoperable patients to receive urgent 3DCRT while simultaneously creating the opportunity for superior outcomes with SBRT. The investigators also aim to characterize the effect on motor function and ambulation, pain and QoL. This study could stimulate further multi-center randomized trials in this area, improve motor function and patient-reported QoL, and contribute to improving oncology care in Canada in a meaningful way.

Different Sessions of Perineural Injection With Dextrose for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
            
","
Brief Summary       
      
Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common peripheral entrapment neuropathy with involving compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. The technique of perineural injection therapy (PIT) by using 5% dextrose (D5W) is now commonly used for peeling the nerve from surrounding soft tissue (called nerve hydrodissection), which may help antineurogenic inflammation, allow the impulse to pass, and rescue the nerve with ischemic damage. However, the evidence and reference of PIT and nerve hydrodissection are very seldom until our series researches since 2017. Moreover, our research revealed PIT with D5W is more beneficial than that of corticosteroid in patients with mild-to-moderate CTS at 4 to 6 months postinjection. However, the accumulative effect and long-term effect (more than 6 months) of PIT is still unknown. Hence, we design a randomized, double- blind, controlled trail to assess the long-term effect of ultrasound-guided PIT in patients with CTS. The aim one is to survey the possible accumulative effect of different sessions of PIT (6 months follow-up) and aim two is to evaluate the long-term effect and safety of PIT (one year follow-up).

Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common compression neuropathy. The compression of the median nerve occurs in the carpal tunnel and results in pain and other unpleasant sensations in hand and wrist. In more advanced stage, weakness and wasting of the thenar and other muscles innervated by median nerve occurs, which may lead to permanent impairment of manual performance. The Boston carpal tunnel questionnaire (BCTQ) is one of the most commonly used tools for monitoring of the disease progression and of the effect of therapy. Originally created in English, it has been translated into many languages and subsequently validated. Recently the Polish version has been created and the purpose of this study is to validate it.

Pain In Neuropathy Study
            
","
Brief Summary       
      
In the context of peripheral neuropathy, we will aim to elucidate correlates between sensory symptoms and:

Sensory nerve dysfunction.
Cutaneous small nerve fibre innervation density.
Psychological co-morbidity.
Circadian rhythm disturbance co-morbidity.
Functionality and Quality of life.

Patterns of human brain activity in a subset of patients that consent to participate in the FMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) component of PINS.
2. We will also collect blood samples in this phenotyped cohort of patients. These blood samples coupled with detailed phenotype data will investigate potential gene associations only in the development of painful neuropathy.
3. Knowledge gained from the study will be used to aid the further development of pain questionnaires, designed to detect patients with painful neuropathy.
4.Knowledge gained from the study will be invaluable in informing on-going investigations of painful peripheral neuropathy in animal models, both in our laboratory and others.

Brief Title       
      
Genetic and Physical Study of Childhood Nerve and Muscle Disorders

","
Brief Summary       
      
Background:
- Some nerve and muscle disorders that start early in life (before age 25), like some forms of muscular dystrophy, can run in families. However, the genetic causes of these disorders are not known. Also, doctors do not fully understand how symptoms of these disorders change over time. Researchers want to learn more about genetic nerve and muscle disorders that start in childhood by studying affected people and their family members, as well as healthy volunteers.
Objectives:
- To better understand nerve and muscle disorders that start early in life and run in families.
Eligibility:

Individuals at least 4 weeks old with childhood-onset muscular and nerve disorders, including those who have a later onset of a disorder that typically has childhood onset.
Affected and unaffected family members of the individuals with muscular and nerve disorders.
Healthy volunteers at least 4 weeks old with no nerve or muscle disorders.

Design:

Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Genetic information will be collected from blood, saliva, cheek swab, or skin samples. Urine samples may also be collected.
Healthy volunteers and unaffected family members will have imaging studies of the muscles. These studies will include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound scans. Results will be compared with those from the affected participants.
All participants with nerve and muscle disorders will have multiple tests, including the following:
Imaging studies of the muscles, including ultrasound and MRI scans.
Imaging studies of the bones, such as x-rays and DEXA scans.
Heart and lung function tests.
Eye exams.
Nerve and muscle electrical activity tests and biopsies.
Video and photo image collection of affected muscles.
Speech, language, and swallowing evaluation.
Lumbar puncture to collect spinal fluid for study.
Tests of movement, attention, thinking, and coordination.
Participants with nerve and muscle disorders will return to the Clinical Center every year. They will repeat the tests and studies at these visits.

Brief Summary       
      
The Registry and Natural History Study for AP-4 Associated Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (AP-4-HSP) is focused on gathering longitudinal clinical data as well as biological samples (skin and/or blood and/or saliva )from male or female patients of all ages with (1) a clinical diagnosis of hereditary spastic paraplegia and/or (2) the presence of variants in AP4-HSP related genes and/or be a relative of a person with such a diagnosis. Currently, the treatment for this disorder is generally symptomatic and available therapies improve quality of life, but are grossly inefficient in slowing the disease progression. Access to the registry information will be limited to the study staff who are responsible for recruitment and maintenance of the registry. The investigators hope that recruitment into registry for studies will advance knowledge of the causes, clinical course, diagnosis and treatment of these conditions.

Brief Summary       
      
The investigators goal is to provide a mechanism that allows for a better understanding of patient outcomes following rehabilitation. This includes functional outcomes measured by standardized and validated tools from the published literature. It incorporates comorbidities and patient demographic characteristics. It includes measures of general health as well along with activities of daily living and behavioral health aspects. Measures of quality and satisfaction and use of Net Promoter Scores also are included. All of these components come together to form a remarkably comprehensive picture of patients and their associated outcomes. This is a unique milestone in rehabilitative care and will act to inform and direct evidence-based approaches and treatment guidelines.
Data are collected via the investigators proprietary electronic medical record system and are synthetic to the clinical process-that is, the data are collected in real-time with patients and the scores are immediately provided to the treating therapist as well as archived for later Registry and scientific use. Subsequent reporting can be risk adjusted to any variable collected which yields robust insights as to idiopathic patient conditions. However, no PHI information will be available.

PCSK9 Inhibitor Treatment for Patients With SPG5
            
","
Brief Summary       
      
Spastic paraplegia type 5 (SPG5) is a rare subtype of hereditary spastic paraplegia, a highly heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders defined by progressive neurodegeneration of the corticospinal tract motor neurons. SPG5 is caused by recessive mutations in the gene CYP7B1 encoding oxysterol-7a-hydroxylase. This enzyme is involved in the degradation of cholesterol into primary bile acids. CYP7B1 deficiency has been shown to lead to accumulation of neurotoxic oxysterols. Oxysterols were found to impair metabolic activity and viability of human cortical neurons at concentrations found in SPG5 patients, indicating that elevated levels of oxysterols might be key pathogenic factors in SPG5. Monoclonal antibodies that inhibit proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) have emerged as a new class of drugs that effectively lower cholesterol levels. Evolocumab, a member of this class, is a fully human monoclonal antibody that reduces LDL cholesterol levels by approximately 60%. We thus performed this interventional trial with Evolocumab 420 mg for SPG5 patients.
