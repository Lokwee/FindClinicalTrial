# FindClinicalTrials

Web app link: https://findclinicaltrial.herokuapp.com/

FindClinicalTrials is a program that enables users to search for currently available and recruiting clinical trials for Genetic Disorders chronicled on Clinvar (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/).
I first scraped https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ by searching for genetic disorders and saving the Conditions column. I then used that information to scrape for available clinical  trials in clinicaltrials.gov and save the information in a MySQL database. 
I used Heroku to deploy the app to the web -- free version.

## Files:
### clinvarClinical.py
In this file, I find genetic disorders from Clinvar. I then look for available clinical trials for each of the disorders and dynamically save this data to a MySQL database.

### connect.py
In this file, I create a MySQL database -- ClinicalTrials -- and make some changes to the GeneticDisorders table.

### app.py
With our database ready and populated, I use flask to create a web app where users can search for available clinical trials. 

### index.html
A file that defines our web app's home page.

### response.html
A file that designs the output of the search results.

### requirements.txt
A file required by Heroku in order to deploy your app.
Automatically generated by running below code
```
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt -- Python3
pip freeze > requirements.txt -- Python2
```

### Procfile
Required by Heroku and only requires one line of code
```
web: gunicorn app:myapp
```

## Lessons Learnt and Future Improvements
1. The web app still defaults to showing the first five clinical trials from our database. 
2. I first created a locally hosted MySQL database and found it difficult to use it to deploy the app -- probably a good thing because unlike Heroku, a locally hosted database would limit the availability of the web app.
3. I had to transfer my database from my local host to clearDB (heroku add-on that enables working with MySQL) -- Heroku is built and works using PostgreSQL. It would probably be easier to use PostgreSQL but I insisted on using MySQL.
